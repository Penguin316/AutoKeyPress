# AutoKeyPress
Simple Python program that automatically presses a key in an open window

I couldn't find a simple command line program that pressed a key n times per second. So I made this

In order for this to run make sure you're using Python 3 (you can check which version from the command line with "python --version") and install pynput with "pip install pynput".

Follow the comments to edit the settings as you see fit. As the file is, the "a" key will be pressed once per second 100 times after an initial 5 second delay

Just run the program from cmd (or you're favorite IDE) by navigating to the directory and then input "python AutoKeyPress.py"

By default, the program will not start inputing for 5 seconds allowing you to switch to the window where you want the key pressed
